# There is a singly-linked list head and we want to delete a node node in it.

# You are given the node to be deleted node. You will not be given access to the first node of head.

# All the values of the linked list are unique, and it is guaranteed that the given node node is not the last node in the linked list.

# Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
# Output: [4,1,9]
# Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.

# Solution
